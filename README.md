# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Dataset

This project aims to analyze and classify sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in tweets using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

Features:
Dataset:
The dataset consists of tweets labeled with their corresponding sentiments, providing a balanced corpus for training and testing the model.

Preprocessing:

Tokenization and text cleaning (removing stop words, URLs, hashtags, and special characters).
Lemmatization for reducing words to their base forms.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizations and insights into the distribution of sentiments, most frequent words, and hashtags.

Modeling:

Multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Fine-tuned deep learning models for improved accuracy.
Evaluation:

Performance evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualizations for confusion matrix and model comparison.
Key Highlights:
Built a robust pipeline for sentiment analysis from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
Achieved high accuracy using optimized models and feature engineering.
Demonstrates the application of NLP techniques for real-world text classification problems.
